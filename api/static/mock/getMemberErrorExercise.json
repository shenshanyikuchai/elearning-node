Its mission is \u2018to maximise shareholder value through supplying good value food and drink inappealing environments for our customers\u2019.Cantor Cafes (Cafes) is the original operating company for the group and is a chain of 115 cafes specialising in\u00a0different coffee drinks but also serving some simple food dishes. Cafes has been running successfully for 15 years\u00a0and has reached the limit of its expansion as the cafe market is now considered to be saturated with competition.\u00a0Further growth will occur only as the opportunity to obtain profitable, new sites is presented, although such\u00a0opportunities are not expected to be significant over the next few years.Cantor Juicey (Juicey) was started by the Cantor Group two years ago. Now, it is made up of 15 juice bars which\u00a0serve a variety of blended fruit juice drinks and health snacks. The products served by Juicey have benefited from anincreased awareness in Deeland of the need to eat and drink healthily. Cantor Group expects to increase the rate of\u00a0property acquisition in order to feed the rapid growth of this business, intending to open 25 outlets per year for thenext four years.Cantor Group organises its two subsidiaries in a similar way, as they are involved in similar areas of business. There\u00a0is one exception to this, namely in the arrangements over the properties from which the subsidiaries operate. Cafesrent their properties on the open market on standard commercial terms with a five-year lease at a fixed rental payable\u00a0quarterly in advance. Juicey, on the other hand, has made a single arrangement with a large commercial landlord forall of its properties. Juicey has agreed that the rent for its sites is a percentage of the revenue generated at each site.\u00a0Juicey believes that it can continue its expansion by obtaining more sites from this landlord under the same terms.The board of Cantor is reviewing their performance reporting systems and would like your evaluation of the current\u00a0report given in Appendix 1. This report contains information for both of the subsidiaries and the group and is used byall three boards. The CEO has advised you that the board does not require an evaluation of Cantor\u2019s performance.\u00a0However, the CEO does want you to consider the cost structures at Cantor and advise on the implications of the mixof fixed and variable elements in the key cost areas of staff and property for performance management.At a recent shareholder meeting of Cantor, one of the large shareholders expressed concern that the group lacks focus\u00a0and suggested the introduction of value-based management (VBM) using economic value added (EVA TM ) as themeasure of value. Cantor\u2019s CEO has asked you, their strategic management accountant, to give the board more\u00a0information on the implications of this suggestion. She has asked you to do an example calculation of the EVA TM forthe Group using the current data (Appendices 1 and 2) and explain how the shareholders might view the result. Next,\u00a0the board needs to have the VBM system explained and evaluated to be able to make a decision about its use at\u00a0Cantor.Finally, the board is considering amending the mission statement to include more information on the ethical values\u00a0of the company. The area being considered for inclusion in the overall mission is on the treatment of employees as itis felt that they should share in the progress and profitability of Cantor since a happy working environment will help\u00a0them to better serve the customers.The proposed new mission statement would read:\u2018to maximise shareholder value and to provide a fair deal to our employees by supplying good value food and drink\u00a0in appealing environments for our customers.\u2019The CEO has asked you to consider how the Group\u2019s performance in the area regarding employees could be measured\u00a0using the current management information at Cantor. You have obtained additional information from the management\u00a0information system to assist with this task, given in Appendix 3.Write a report to the CEO of Cantor to:(i) Evaluate the current performance report in Appendix 1.\u00a0(ii) Assess the balance of fixed and variable elements of the CEO\u2019s two key costs in each of the two subsidiaries\u00a0and the impact which this may have on performance management of these costs.Note: Detailed calculations are not required. (6 marks)(iii) Evaluate the economic value added (EVA TM ) of Cantor Group, justifying any assumptions made.(iv) Explain how value-based management (VBM) could be implemented at Cantor and evaluate its potential\u00a0impact on the group.(v) Using the information in the appendices, provide justified recommendations for suitable performance\u00a0measures to reflect the proposed change in the company\u2019s mission statement.Professional marks will be awarded for the format, style and structure of the discussion of your answer.","sort":"2","examen_id":"ff8080814d1db79b014d326473d4032f","exerciseid":"ff8080814cd9d8e3014d0348d20903b5"},{"createDate":1504601455,"exercise_name":"\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9898","sort":"3","examen_id":"ff8080814d1db79b014d326473d4032f","exerciseid":"ff8080814cd9d8e3014d033be32303b4"},{"createDate":1504601455,"exercise_name":"\u5e94\u6025\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u54ea\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6280\u672f","sort":"4","examen_id":"ff8080814d1db79b014d326473d4032f","exerciseid":"ff8080814cd9d8e3014d02fca55003b1"}]},{"examen_name":"\u77e5\u8bc6\u70b9\u7ec3\u4e60","examen_type":"knowledge","exercise_list":[{"createDate":1502157882,"exercise_name":"\u5f53\u5c06\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ecf\u8425\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u54ea\u4e2a\u63cf\u8ff0\u662f\u6700\u6070\u5f53\u7684?","sort":"0","examen_id":"8a22ecb55aa7aa10015ac65817840a36","exerciseid":"8a22ecb55b7a030e015b7b2b75d80092"},{"createDate":1502161085,"exercise_name":"\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6d89\u53ca\u804c\u80fd\u6218\u7565\u7684\u54ea\u9879\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff1f","sort":"1","examen_id":"8a22ecb55aa7aa10015ac65817840a36","exerciseid":"ff8080814f1c162a014f200e6b482543"},{"createDate":1502161188,"exercise_name":"Wong\u516c\u53f8\u91c7\u7528\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ecf\u8425\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u54ea\u9879\u4e00\u822c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212?","sort":"26","examen_id":"8a22ecb55aa7aa10015ac65817840a36","exerciseid":"8a22ecb55b7a030e015b7b2c4ec00094"},{"createDate":1502161109,"exercise_name":"\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u8005&ldquo;\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48&rdquo;\u4e0e&ldquo;\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e0c\u671b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48&rdquo;\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u662f","sort":"28","examen_id":"8a22ecb55aa7aa10015ac65817840a36","exerciseid":"8a22ecb55b7a030e015b7b408fad00a0"}]}]}
